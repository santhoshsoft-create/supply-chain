Title: AI-Powered supply chain management

Abstract The AI-Powered Supply Chain Management project enhances supply chain efficiency by integrating artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and real-time IoT data. The system uses AI models to forecast demand, optimize logistics, and minimize disruptions. This document presents the final demonstration and technical documentation, highlighting system architecture, performance metrics, and testing outcomes. The project is scalable, secure, and designed for integration with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.

Project Demonstration :

Overview: The system will be demonstrated to stakeholders to showcase key features such as demand prediction, logistics optimization, inventory tracking, and performance analytics.

Demonstration Details: ❖ System Walkthrough: Live demo from supplier input to product delivery tracking. ❖ AI Forecasting: Showcasing prediction accuracy for inventory needs based on past data. ❖ Iot Integration: Real-time tracking of shipments using GPS and sensor data. ❖ Performance Metrics: Load testing, latency analysis, and scalability under concurrent user traffic. ❖ Security Measures: Demonstrating data encryption and access control.

Outcome: Stakeholders will observe the system's ability to optimize operations, enhance visibility, and adapt to dynamic changes in supply and demand.

Project Documentation Overview: Complete documentation is provided to detail system development, architecture, operation, and management. Documentation Sections: ❖ System Architecture: Diagrams of AI pipelines, data flow, and ERP integration. ❖ Code Documentation: Explanation of scripts for data ingestion, model training, and UI logic. ❖ User Guide: Instructions for warehouse managers, suppliers, and logistics personnel. ❖ Administrator Guide: Setup, monitoring, and maintenance instructions. ❖ Testing Reports: Performance, stress testing, and integration validation results. Outcome: A comprehensive guide ensuring smooth system operation, scaling, and troubleshooting.

Phase-3

Automates repetitive tasks like ETA requests or stock reordering Sources: ERP systems, IoT sensors, sales data, weather data, market trends, supplier performance logs. Dashboards for managers to view metrics and alerts in real time Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users accessing critical systems. Basic AI Model: The AI should be able to assess simple symptoms and provide relevant advice to users. phase-4

Clean and enrich datasets from ERP, CRM, IoT sensors, etc. Improve understanding using custom vocabulary, synonyms, and domain-specific expressions. Improve understanding using custom vocabulary, synonyms, and domain-specific expressions. Use API gateways and firewalls to protect data exchanged with third-party systems. Establish benchmarks or SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for operations.
